# This is a test website

I am a first-year PhD student at Peking University under the advisor of [Prof. Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/). Before becoming a PhD candidate, I obtained my B.S. from Turing Class, Peking University. My research mainly focues on theoretical reinforecement learning and online learning, including the exploration challenge, bandits problem, etc. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or have anything to talk with me!
