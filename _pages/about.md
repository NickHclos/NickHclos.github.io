My name is Jiachen Hu (胡家琛), a third-year PhD student at Peking University. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Professor [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/), and spend wonderful times working with [Chi Jin](https://sites.google.com/view/cjin/home?pli=1) and [Lihong Li](https://lihongli.github.io/) for past years. Before becoming a PhD candidate, I obtained my B.S. from Turing Class, Peking University. 

I have board insterests in sample efficient reinforcement learing and online learning, especially the application-driven problems. In the past few years, my researches focused on statistically efficient bandits (e.g., multi-armed bandits, linear bandits), online exploration in structured MDPs/POMDPs, and understanding sim-to-real transfer. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my researches or having a chat with me!

My curriculum vitae can be found [here](https://nickhclos.github.io/files/cv.pdf).

# Misc

- I am a big fan of baseball (my favorite team is LA Dodgers, :-P), and currently playing as an infielder in the PKU baseball team.
